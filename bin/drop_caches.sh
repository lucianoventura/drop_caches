# this script is based on this site, available and online in 2014-07-30:

# Documentation for /proc/sys/vm/*    kernel version 2.6.29
#     (c) 1998, 1999,  Rik van Riel <riel@nl.linux.org>

# 
# ==============================================================
# 
# This file contains the documentation for the sysctl files in
# /proc/sys/vm and is valid for Linux kernel version 2.6.29.
# 
# The files in this directory can be used to tune the operation
# of the virtual memory (VM) subsystem of the Linux kernel and
# the writeout of dirty data to disk.
# 
# Default values and initialization routines for most of these
# files can be found in mm/swap.c.
#
# drop_caches
# 
# Writing to this will cause the kernel to drop clean caches, as well as
# reclaimable slab objects like dentries and inodes.  Once dropped, their
# memory becomes free.
# 
# To free pagecache:
#     echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# To free reclaimable slab objects (includes dentries and inodes):
#     echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# To free slab objects and pagecache:
#     echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# 
# This is a non-destructive operation and will not free any dirty objects.
# To increase the number of objects freed by this operation, the user may run
# `sync' prior to writing to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.  This will minimize the
# number of dirty objects on the system and create more candidates to be
# dropped.
# 
# This file is not a means to control the growth of the various kernel caches
# (inodes, dentries, pagecache, etc...)  These objects are automatically
# reclaimed by the kernel when memory is needed elsewhere on the system.
# 
# Use of this file can cause performance problems.  Since it discards cached
# objects, it may cost a significant amount of I/O and CPU to recreate the
# dropped objects, especially if they were under heavy use.  Because of this,
# use outside of a testing or debugging environment is not recommended.
